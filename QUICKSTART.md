source venv/bin/activate

# Start Prism (runs until you press Ctrl+C)
python -m prism.main start
```

### Check Status
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python -m prism.main status
```

### Using the Makefile (Recommended)
```bash
# Start monitoring
make run

# Check status
make status

# View dashboard (when tkinter is available)
make dashboard

# Clean up old data
make cleanup
```

## 🎛️ Configuration

Your configuration is stored at: `~/.prism/config.json`

Key settings you can modify:
- Screenshot interval (default: 30 seconds)
- OCR settings
- Privacy exclusions
- Encryption settings

## 📊 Data Storage

- **Database**: `data/prism.db` (SQLite)
- **Screenshots**: Encrypted and stored in database
- **Logs**: `~/.prism/logs/`
- **Config**: `~/.prism/config.json`

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- All data is stored locally on your machine
- Screenshots are encrypted by default
- Sensitive applications (1Password, Keychain, etc.) are excluded
- You can add custom exclusions in the config

## 📈 Current Data Captured

- Screenshots: 3 captured
- Database size: 9.1 MB
- Activities: Ready for classification

## 🛠️ Commands Available

```bash
# Initialize/reinitialize
python -m prism.main init

# Start monitoring
python -m prism.main start

# Check status
python -m prism.main status

# Clean up old data (7 days default)
python -m prism.main cleanup --days 7
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

1. **OCR Errors**: Normal during testing, will resolve during full runs
2. **Dashboard Issues**: tkinter may need separate installation
3. **Permissions**: Ensure Terminal has Screen Recording access in System Preferences

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Run for a full session**: Let Prism monitor for 30+ minutes to see real activity classification
2. **Review data**: Use status command to see captured data
3. **Customize settings**: Edit the config file for your preferences
4. **Install tkinter**: For dashboard functionality

## 💡 Tips

- Prism captures screenshots every 30 seconds by default
- OCR text extraction happens asynchronously
- Activity classification improves with more data
- All processing happens locally for privacy

Enjoy using Prism! 🔍✨
